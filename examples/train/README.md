# Model Training Scripts

This folder contain scripts for calling the `verl-tool` pipeline for training models with tool-calling capability. 

Specifically, `acecoder` is used for training tool-calling coding models. `torl` is used to train tool-calling mathematical models. Other folders are currently under development.
